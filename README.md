# Panels PrintPDF

A Drupal 7 module that allows any panel variant to render as a PDF to the browser. It adds a new Rendering option to panels named "Print PDF". This display renderer (sometimes called a renderer pipeline) delivers the rendered panel to the browser as a PDF leveraging the print_pdf module. Enable this Renderer on a panel variant's "General" tab.

Requires the completed install of the print_pdf module that comes with [https://www.drupal.org/project/print](print), and its PDF generation tool. Panel PDFs use the global settings as determined by the print_pdf module.
